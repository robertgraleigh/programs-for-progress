					<p class="serif-reg">Many of you already know that Dr. Wright maintains a part-time practice in the field of forensic odontology. He is a member of the American Society of Forensic Odontology, a fellowin the American Academy of Forensic-Sciences-Odontology Section, and a diplomat of the American Board of Forensic Odontology. There are any number of cases in which he is involved at any given time, any and all of which challenge Dr. Wright in the application of the profession of dentistry to the profession of law. The expectation of this part of our office web siteis to introduce the reader to the intriguing field of forensic odontology.</p>
					<p class="serif-reg">Forensic dentistry, which is sometimes referred to as forensic odontology, is an exciting and dynamic area of dentistry where dentistry interacts with the law. While the names are interchangeable, the field of forensic dentistry is commonly recognized by the identification of human remains, but it involves much more. It istrue that the majority of the case work for many forensic dentists relates primarily to dental identification but they can also become involved in other areas, which include mass disaster dental identification, human abuse cases, bit mark patterns, and dental-legal issues.</p>
